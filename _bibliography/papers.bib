	abstract = {Reconstructing the history of somatic DNA alterations can help understand the evolution of a tumor and predict its resistance to treatment. Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) can be used to investigate clonal heterogeneity and to inform phylogeny reconstruction. However, most existing phylogenetic methods for scDNAseq data are designed either for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or for large copy number alterations (CNAs), or are not applicable to targeted sequencing. Here, we develop COMPASS, a computational method for inferring the joint phylogeny of SNVs and CNAs from targeted scDNAseq data. We evaluate COMPASS on simulated data and apply it to several datasets including a cohort of 123 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. COMPASS detected clonal CNAs that could be orthogonally validated with bulk data, in addition to subclonal ones that require single-cell resolution, some of which point toward convergent evolution.},

	abstract = {T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 (TAL1) is one of the most frequently deregulated oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Its deregulation can occur through diverse cis-alterations, including SIL-TAL1 microdeletions, translocations with T-cell Receptor loci, and more recently described upstream intergenic non-coding mutations. These mutations consist of recurrent focal microinsertions that create an oncogenic neo-enhancer accompanied by activating epigenetic marks. This observation laid the groundwork for an innovative paradigm concerning the activation of proto-oncogenes via genomic alterations of non-coding intergenic regions. However, for the majority of T-ALL expressing TAL1 (TAL1+), the deregulation mechanism remains 'unresolved'. We took advantage of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data of eight cases of T-ALL, including five TAL1+ cases. We identified a putative novel oncogenic neo-enhancer downstream of TAL1 in an unresolved monoallelic TAL1+ case. A rare but recurrent somatic heterozygous microinsertion within this region creates a de novo binding site for MYB transcription factor. Here we demonstrate that this mutation leads to increased enhancer activity, gain of active epigenetic marks, and TAL1 activation via recruitment of MYB. These results highlight the diversity of non-coding mutations that can drive oncogene activation.},
